# APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT BSIT 301
My name is **Jeorge Trixie E. De Lara** and I live in Lucban, Quezon. I'm a 4th year student taking a bachelor's degree in Information Technology at STI College Sta. Cruz. Studying, this taught me how I will act in the real world or industry. Teaches me a lot of skills and knowledge that I can bring with me as I go on my journey. Being an IT student is not what I dream of but luckily I'm still here and in a few more steps I'll be graduating already, hoping. 


#*My Goals in Life*
- Find a job.

- Treat my family and friends.
- Improve my skills and abilities.
- Invest.
- To be a flight attendant.
- Civil Service Passer.
- Own a car, house, and lot. 
- Have my own business.
